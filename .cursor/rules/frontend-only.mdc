# Frontend-only Editing Rules

You are working strictly in the frontend app under `Stalk_FE/`. Do not modify files outside this directory unless the user explicitly asks.

## Do
- Keep all edits scoped to `Stalk_FE/`.
- Read the minimal set of relevant files before editing. Prefer small, focused edits.
- Preserve existing UI/UX, styles, and layout unless explicitly requested.
- Follow the existing project conventions (assume Google style) and the repo ESLint rules in [eslint.config.js](mdc:Stalk_FE/eslint.config.js).
- Use TypeScript best practices: explicit function signatures for exported APIs, avoid `any`, and maintain type safety.
- After edits, ensure no new ESLint/TS errors are introduced.
- Maintain import path aliases (e.g., `@/`) and avoid breaking build config.
- Prefer incremental changes: add helper functions instead of large refactors.
- Add only strictly necessary code; keep diffs minimal and readable.
- Provide a brief high-signal summary of what changed and why.

## Do Not
- Do not edit backend (`Stalk_BE/`), Docker, NGINX, or deployment files unless explicitly instructed.
- Do not change global styles, component structure, or visual layout without a direct request.
- Do not introduce new dependencies or scripts without approval.
- Do not change linting or formatting configuration.
- Do not rename or move files unless required for the task.
- Do not remove existing types or relax type safety to silence errors.

## Modern Workflow Hints
- Plan → Apply → Verify: briefly plan the change, implement minimal edits, then verify types/lints.
- Constrain scope: touch only files necessary to achieve the outcome.
- Acceptance criteria: confirm the user-visible behavior matches the request; no regressions; zero linter/type errors.
- Keep messages concise; surface only critical info. Avoid speculative changes.

## File/Folder Guidance
- Entry point and routing live in [Stalk_FE/src/App.tsx](mdc:Stalk_FE/src/App.tsx) and page files under [Stalk_FE/src/pages/](mdc:Stalk_FE/src/pages/).
- UI components live under [Stalk_FE/src/components/](mdc:Stalk_FE/src/components/). Keep domain-specific parts in their subfolders (e.g., `stock/`, `consultation/`, `forms/`, `modals/`, `ui/`).
- API/client calls live under [Stalk_FE/src/services/](mdc:Stalk_FE/src/services/). One service per backend domain; do not mix concerns.
- Shared types/interfaces live under [Stalk_FE/src/types/](mdc:Stalk_FE/src/types/index.ts).
- Global contexts live under [Stalk_FE/src/context/](mdc:Stalk_FE/src/context/). Reuse existing `AuthContext` and `WatchlistContext` when relevant.
- Reusable hooks live under [Stalk_FE/src/hooks/](mdc:Stalk_FE/src/hooks/). Put page-specific logic inside the page, not here.
- Constants live under [Stalk_FE/src/constants/](mdc:Stalk_FE/src/constants/index.ts).
- Utilities live under [Stalk_FE/src/utils/](mdc:Stalk_FE/src/utils/index.ts).
- Static assets live under [Stalk_FE/src/assets/](mdc:Stalk_FE/src/assets/) and public files under [Stalk_FE/public/](mdc:Stalk_FE/public/).

## File Placement Guide
- New page: place under `Stalk_FE/src/pages/` and register route in [Stalk_FE/src/App.tsx](mdc:Stalk_FE/src/App.tsx).
- New API call: add to the appropriate file under `Stalk_FE/src/services/` or create a focused service file; keep request/response types in `Stalk_FE/src/types/`.
- New shared component: `Stalk_FE/src/components/` (match existing subfolder by domain; avoid generic dumps).
- New hook: `Stalk_FE/src/hooks/` with a descriptive name; keep side effects explicit and typed.
- New shared constant or util: `Stalk_FE/src/constants/` or `Stalk_FE/src/utils/` respectively.

## Conventions (TypeScript + React)
- Prefer explicit types for exported functions and component props; avoid `any`.
- Keep components presentational; move data fetching to pages or hooks.
- Maintain accessibility and semantic HTML; do not regress keyboard navigation.
- Keep imports stable using path aliases (e.g., `@/services/...`).
- Follow ESLint rules from [eslint.config.js](mdc:Stalk_FE/eslint.config.js). Fix or refactor rather than disabling rules.

When referencing project files in instructions or summaries, use their exact paths under `Stalk_FE/`.
